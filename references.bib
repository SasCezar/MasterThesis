NCRF++ is designed for quick implementation of different neural sequence labeling models with a CRF inference layer. It provides users with an inference for building the custom model structure through configuration file with flexible neural feature design and utilization. Built on PyTorch\footnote{\url{http://pytorch.org/}}, the core operations are calculated in batch, making the toolkit efficient with the acceleration of GPU. It also includes the implementations of most state-of-the-art neural sequence labeling models such as LSTM-CRF, facilitating reproducing and refinement on those methods.},

	novel greedy top-down inference algorithm based on recursive partitioning of
	the input. We demonstrate empirically that both prediction schemes are
	competitive with recent work, and when combined with basic extensions to the
	scoring model are capable of achieving state-of-the-art single-model
	performance on the Penn Treebank (91.79 F1) and strong performance on the
	French Treebank (82.23 F1).},
